<p>During my undergraduate studies, I had opportunities to experience RF system design.<br />
During my masters, I studied time-frequency analysis focusing on Wigner-Ville Distribution.<br />
Currently, I am working as an analog circuit designer to fulfill my military service.<br />

<p>Traditional frequency analysis has its background in Fourier Transform, which provides information only on frequency components.<br />
WVD (Wigner-Ville Distribution) provides joint information on time and frequency.<br />
With appropriate kernel design, WVD provides far more information than Fourier Transform, without significant loss of information.<br />

<p>I designed analog blocks including crystal oscillator, charge pump, LDO, and PLL.<br />
<br />
32kHz Crystal oscillator, LF6S<br />
Charge Pump, LF6S<br />
<br />
LDO, SMIC40LL<br />
PLL, SMIC40LL<br /></p>
