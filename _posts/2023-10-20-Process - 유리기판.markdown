반도체기판은 칩과 컴퓨터 메인보드를 연결하는 부품이다. 현재 플라스틱과 같은 유기소재가 널리 쓰인다. 여러 개의 칩이 하나의 반도체처럼 동작하는 이종집적을 위해선 칩과 유기기판 사이 인터포저(중간 기판)가 필요하다.

고집적 패키지 기판이 필요한 AI용 반도체는 실리콘으로 만든 인터포저를 활용한다. 문제는 실리콘 인터포저 공정이 반도체 전공정에 준할 정도로 복잡해 상당한 비용이 들어간다는 점이다. 유기기판의 대안으로 부상한 게 유리기판이다. 유리기판은 휘어짐에 강하고 평탄도가 높아 인터포저를 탑재하지 않아도 된다. 유기기판보다 많은 트랜지스터 집적이 가능해 이론상 유기기판보다 데이터 처리량이 8배 많고 전력소비는 절반에 불과한 것으로 알려졌다. 단점도 있다. 유리 특성상 누적압력이나 외부충격에 쉽게 깨져 수율(결함 없는 합격품 비율)이 떨어진다. 유리기판이 반도체 시장으로 진입하지 못한 결정적 이유다. 유리기판이 대세로 자리잡기 위해선 관련 기술개발과 공정 최적화가 이뤄져야 한다. 아직 주요 반도체 기업들은 유리기판 공급망을 완전히 구축하지 못했다.

Introduction to Glass PCB
A glass printed circuit board (Glass PCB) is a specialized type of printed circuit board (PCB) that uses glass as the base substrate material instead of the more common FR-4 fiberglass. Glass offers some unique advantages over FR-4 that make it an attractive option for certain applications requiring high performance, reliability and durability.
Advantages of Glass PCBs
Here are some of the main benefits of using glass PCBs:
Excellent thermal conductivity - Glass has much higher thermal conductivity compared to standard FR-4. This allows Glass PCBs to dissipate heat efficiently.
Low thermal expansion - The coefficient of thermal expansion of glass is much lower than FR-4. This results in greater board stability over a wide temperature range.
High frequency support - The stable dielectric properties of glass enable Glass PCBs to support higher operating frequencies. Glass has low dielectric loss at high frequencies.
Excellent chemical resistance - Glass provides superior chemical resistance and won't absorb moisture like FR-4. This improves the reliability and lifespan of Glass PCBs.
High strength - Glass has very high flexural strength and is highly resistant to cracks and fractures. This makes Glass PCBs suitable for demanding structural applications.
Applications of Glass PCBs

Some of the common applications where Glass PCBs provide technical advantages include:
High speed digital circuits - Used in compute, telecom, automotive and medical applications requiring multi-GHz frequencies.
High power circuits - The thermal conductivity handles high power densities efficiently. Used in power electronics.
High temperature electronics - Glass PCBs can operate continuously at over 200°C making them suitable for downhole, aerospace and automotive applications.
High frequency antennas - The stable dielectric properties are ideal for antenna applications up to mmWave frequencies.
Sensors and transducers - Resistant to corrosion and humidity, glass PCBs are widely used in harsh environment sensors.
Medical electronics - The durability and biological inertness allows use in implantable devices.
Glass PCB Materials and Properties
Glass PCBs are fabricated from a range of different glass material types, tailored to meet application requirements. Some common types of glass used include:
Borosilicate Glass
Borosilicate glass is one of the most common types used for PCBs. Key properties include:
High thermal shock resistance
Low thermal expansion coefficient
Excellent chemical resistance
High strength
Operating temperatures up to 315°C
Borosilicate glass is widely used in high reliability electronic assemblies. It provides a good combination of electrical, thermal and mechanical characteristics.
Aluminosilicate Glass
Aluminosilicate glass has similar properties to borosilicate but with even lower dielectric loss, enabling higher frequency operation. Key properties are:
Extremely low dielectric loss
Low dielectric constant
Near zero thermal expansion coefficient
High thermal conductivity
High flexural strength
Aluminosilicate Glass PCBs are used in specialized high frequency applications like radars, satellite communications and 5G equipment.
Fused Silica Glass


Fused silica glass is an ultrapure glass made only from silicon dioxide. It has exceptional thermal stability and the lowest thermal expansion of any glass. Key properties:
Extremely low thermal expansion coefficient
Excellent thermal shock resistance
High strength and stiffness
High optical transmission
Stable dielectric properties
Withstands over 1000°C
Fused silica glass PCBs are used in space, aerospace and other demanding applications with extreme temperature cycling requirements.
E-Glass
E-Glass is aluminoborosilicate glass reinforced with glass fibers, giving it excellent mechanical strength while maintaining high heat resistance and stable electrical properties.
Glass PCB Manufacturing Process
Glass offers unique advantages but is also challenging to manufacture into PCBs compared to standard FR-4 laminates. Here is an overview of the manufacturing process flow:
Glass Panel Preparation
Glass sheets are cut to size from large glass panels to match PCB panel dimensions.
Holes are drilled for tooling and alignment.
Notches and cutouts are machined by laser or water jet cutting.
Cleaning and Surface Treatment
Glass panels go through ultrasonic cleaning tanks and surface treatments to remove contaminants and improve adhesion.
A coupling agent layer may be applied to enhance bonding to the metallization layers.
Metallization and Imaging
The first metal layer is deposited by sputtering, evaporation or plating processes.
A photoresist is applied and patterned by lithography processes.
The exposed metal is etched to form the desired circuit pattern.
Layer Build Up
Additional metal and dielectric build-up layers are added to form a multilayer board using lithography processes.
Microvias create interconnections between the layers.
Blind and buried vias are possible by using laser drilling.
Component Assembly
Active and passive components are assembled onto the glass PCB using soldering or conductive adhesives.
Glass is difficult to drill so larger through holes may need to be molded into the glass.
Testing and Singulation

The glass PCB panel goes through electrical testing.
Individual PCBs are separated by scoring, laser cutting or dicing methods.
Final electrical tests are performed on singulated boards.
Comparison between Glass PCB and FR4 PCB
Glass and FR4 PCBs have quite different properties and performance tradeoffs:

FAQs
What are some common applications of glass PCBs?
Some common applications are in high speed digital systems, mmWave antennas, aerospace and automotive electronics, high power devices, and high temperature industrial electronics. Glass PCBs are used where their properties like low loss, thermal stability, chemical resistance and high strength are needed.
How is heat dissipation better in glass PCBs?
The thermal conductivity of glass is 4-5 times higher than FR4. This allows glass PCBs to conduct heat efficiently to connected heat sinks and the surrounding environment. High power components can thus be operated at higher temperatures without overheating.
Can components be soldered onto glass PCBs?
Yes, components can be soldered onto glass PCBs, but the glass surface requires additional surface preparation to create a suitable pad finish. Conductive adhesives are also usable but soldering is preferred for high reliability connections.
Are glass PCBs compatible with lead-free soldering?
Lead-free soldering processes are compatible with glass PCBs provided the board and solder masks can withstand the higher reflow temperatures. Solder masks with high temperature stability are selected.
How rigid and fragile are glass PCBs?
The strength of glass PCBs depends on the glass type - fused silica has the highest rigidity and flexural strength. With proper handling, glass PCBs are not inherently fragile but have higher strength than organic boards. Cutting and machining require diamond-tipped tools.
