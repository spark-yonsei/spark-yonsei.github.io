During my undergraduate studies, I had opportunities to experience RF system design.<br>
During my masters, I studied time-frequency analysis focusing on Wigner-Ville Distribution.<br>
Currently, I am working as an analog circuit designer to fulfill my military service.<br>
<br>
<br>
### RF System Design<br>
<br>
<br>
### Time-Frequency Analysis<br>
Traditional frequency analysis has its background in Fourier Transform, which provides information only on frequency components.<br>
WVD (Wigner-Ville Distribution) provides joint information on time and frequency.<br>
With appropriate kernel design, WVD provides far more information than Fourier Transform, without significant loss of information.<br>
<br>
### Analog Circuit Design<br>
I designed analog blocks including crystal oscillator, charge pump, LDO, and PLL.<br>
<br>
32kHz Crystal oscillator, LF6S<br>
Charge Pump, LF6S<br>
<br>
LDO, SMIC40LL<br>
PLL, SMIC40LL<br>
